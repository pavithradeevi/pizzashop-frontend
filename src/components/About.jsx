        <h1>When Is It Time to Sell?</h1>
        <p>
        The process of positioning your restaurant for sale can never start too early. However, regardless of when the process begins, your business will be valued based on the prior year’s financial performance. So, if the goal is to maximize the payout on the sale, then you will want at least two years of financials and, ideally, a positive gross-revenue growth trend. This will make your restaurant more appealing to potential buyers and, simply put, a pizzeria that makes money is easier to sell than one that does not.

Selling a restaurant is a full-time job. Between marketing the business with a level of confidentiality and vetting the financial position of the buyers, there is not much time to spend actively running your pizzeria. As an owner, the last thing you would want is for your business to suffer because your time has shifted to selling the business rather than running it.

Contacting a professional business broker to provide an opinion of value and guidance will serve you well, 
as your focus can be the continued success of the business 
while your agent works to bring in qualified buyers for its purchase.

            It is rare to find an owner who can objectively price their business, especially since they are not actively selling different types of pizzerias regularly and it’s difficult to remove one’s emotions from the valuation. Like all economics, the market sets the price at which the business will sell, and there are a number of variables that either add value to or reduce value from your business.

A helpful exercise involves putting yourself in the position of a prospective buyer. Ask yourself the tough questions and look objectively at your role as the owner, number of hours you put in the business a week, duties and responsibilities, and the net income. If you have a sale price you believe you “should” get for your business, ask yourself: Would I pay that amount to have to do all the 
work I currently do to make my level of net income?

            For example, if you wanted $250,000 for your pizza shop and you consistently made $80,000 a year working 40+ hours a week, ask yourself: Would I pay $250,000 to buy myself a job that pays $80,000 a year? This is the first question any buyer will ask themselves when presented with the asking price and cashflow amount of a business on the market.

Working with your broker, you will gain a better understanding of the market and how potential buyers approach a purchase—thus helping to put all the pieces in place to increase the appeal of your business for acquisition.
