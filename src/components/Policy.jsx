            Determining Sale Price

            As mentioned briefly above, the value of your pizza shop depends on several variables. These include, but are not limited to, financials, the owner’s role and number of hours a week spent in the business, organizational structure, presence or absence of management or key employee(s), quality of the financial bookkeeping, level of cashflow, and how the business is trending year over year.

Ideally, financials should consist of the last three years of income statements and balance sheets along with corresponding tax returns. A profitable pizzeria is valued based on the seller’s discretionary earnings. These earnings are the pretax and pre-interest profits before non-cash expenses, one-time investments and any non-related income expenses. The higher the discretionary earnings amount, the greater the multiple of that number the market will bear, thus, allowing you to sell for a higher price.

            You should maintain high quality standards throughout the period you are actively trying to sell your pizzeria. No one wants to purchase a pizza shop they would not eat in themselves. A clean restaurant gives the impression that you care about the business, and this attention to detail will also strengthen the buyer’s belief in the accuracy of your financial representations.

A buyer will also be hesitant to spend top dollar to purchase a business that requires immediate repairs to the equipment. Either replace the equipment or be prepared to be asked to adjust the sales price following due diligence. I am not advising that you spend money to upgrade your restaurant with the sole purpose of getting a better price—something that is common in residential real estate. Just maintain your equipment, and keep both the front and back of the house clean.

            Smart buyers will do their due diligence in researching your business. They can easily see the public’s perception of your pizza shop through online reviews. Maintaining a good reputation while obtaining new five-star reviews is important. Good reviews go a long way in solidifying the goodwill associated with your pizza shop.

Bolster your positive reviews while driving down any old negative reviews. You drive down negative reviews by asking happy customers to post positive reviews. Pizzerias with negative reviews are often unappealing to buyers, since a majority of what they are purchasing is the goodwill of the business.

Familiarize yourself with common complaints, such as cold food or slow service and fix those issues before a potential buyer sees them. Being familiar with the complaints will help you be prepared to answer questions relating to these complaints from prospective buyers.

Respond politely to negative reviews about your pizza shop. This shows you take an interest in all aspects of the customer experience. Improving these issues today will help your chances of selling your pizzeria for the highest value in the future.

These situations are perfect examples of why planning an exit is so important. A two-year gap since your last negative reviews will make it easier to sell your pizza shop.

Selling your pizzeria can be a complex and personal process. But hiring a reputable broker—and developing a plan together to position your pizzeria in the best possible light—will put more money in your pocket
